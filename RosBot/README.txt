This project was created for a obstacle avoidance course race and is implemented on the Husarian RosBot 2.0.

The main files in this repository required to run the program are the avidance_IR_RP_OOP.py and correction_service_server.py

The launch file contains the required call for starting the relevant nodes and the software is dependent on the preinstalled files that come with husarion rosbot. 

If you wish to test this on simulation please change the topic names.
